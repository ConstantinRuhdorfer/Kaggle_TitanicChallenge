# Kaggle titanic challenge

You can learn everything about this challenge here https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.
You can also find the data there.

At the moment I only tried out random forest classification on this dataset but I want to extend this repo by adding more algorithms in the future.

The jupyter notebook will walk you through the code and should help beginners to get the idea.

Cheers!
